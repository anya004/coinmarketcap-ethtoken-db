description: Flowchain is an IoT project that leverages distributed ledger technology (DLT) for peer-to-peer
  IoT networks and real-time data transaction. Flowchain's PPKI technology provides random and unique
  public keys in real-time for tokenized hardware that enables the fast and safe transfer of transacted
  digital assets without the need for any intermediaries. As Flowchain's digital asset, FLC ensures the
  security and validity of data through tokenized IoT hardware.
