description: "###What is BitCherry? \n\nBitCherry offers commercial scalable blockchain infrastructure\
  \ based on IPv8 technology. It aims to offer three characteristics: data security, efficient performance,\
  \ and consensus governance. Building a ‘P2Plus’ Encryption Protocol with a physical layer, BitCherry\
  \ is a general blockchain infrastructure that aims to meet the demand of commerce. BitCherry provides\
  \ operational mechanisms such as smart contracts and cross-chain consensus with the goal of achieving\
  \ a scalable data architecture through a hash map algorithm. The blockchain infrastructure aims to reduce\
  \ development costs, provide a high-performance, high-secure, and high-available underlying public chain\
  \ support for distributed commerce on the chain.\n\n- Performance: By optimizing BitCherry hash map\
  \ algorithm, it aims to reduce web traffic and redundant consensus nodes and speed up the process of\
  \ final confirmations.\n- Ecosystem Governance: Based on the hash map data structure, BitCherry combines\
  \ blockchain technology with sixth-degree social theory and creates a consensus called aBFT + PoUc.\n\
  - Data security: Based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs, BitCherry claims to offer identity authentication while\
  \ preserving privacy."
