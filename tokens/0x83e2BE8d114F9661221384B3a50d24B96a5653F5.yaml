description: '0xcert provides the open-source 0xcert Framework for building powerful decentralized applications
  (dapps) combined with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Framework is a JavaScript library that reduces
  the time, resources, and issues of developing a dapp. The 0xcert Framework provides support for implementing
  both ERC-20 fungible tokens as well as ERC-721 non-fungible tokens. The mission is to provide a blockchain-agnostic

  0xcert provides the open-source 0xcert Framework for building powerful decentralized applications (dapps)
  combined with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Framework is a JavaScript library that reduces the time,
  resources, and issues of developing a dapp. The 0xcert Framework provides support for implementing both
  ERC-20 fungible tokens as well as ERC-721 non-fungible tokens. The mission is to provide a blockchain-agnostic
  platform for building dapps.

  ZXC (fungible ERC-20 token) is the native utility token of the 0xcert protocol and was introduced to
  align issuing parties with dapps and the community. With the infrastructure built around the system
  of smart contracts, its primary role is to provide the incentive mechanisms and support the ecosystem
  with low fees.
