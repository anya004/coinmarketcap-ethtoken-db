description: 'INT aims to build a cellular network of machines and create a coin to coordinate the exchange
  of value between nodes and heterogeneous links (different nodes may create independent internal links).
  For example, a node may make a request and pay tokens to request other nodes (or links) to provide resources
  such as power, network. data, and services. Through zero-knowledge proofs, optional masking may be used
  to protect user privacy.
