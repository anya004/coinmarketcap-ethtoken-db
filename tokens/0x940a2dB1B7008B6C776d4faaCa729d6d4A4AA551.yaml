description: "###What is Dusk Network?\n\nDusk Network describes itself as a blockchain for programmable\
  \ and confidential securities, powered by Zero-Knowledge proofs and novel Private PoS leader extraction-based\
  \ consensus protocol. Dusk Network is a privacy blockchain for financial applications. It is a layer-1\
  \ blockchain that powers the Confidential Security Contract (XSC) standard, and supports native confidential\
  \ smart contracts. \n\nDusk Network aims to address the requirements and needs of financial markets.\
  \ Central to its design is a scalable public infrastructure, direct settlement finality of transactions,\
  \ and strict data privacy.\n\n- Direct settlement finality. A distributed Financial Market Infrastructure\
  \ (dFMI) should provide clear and final settlement of transactions. On Dusk Network transactions are\
  \ fast, take seconds to complete, and achieve immediate on-chain finality.\n- Privacy. Dusk Network\
  \ provides full user privacy and enables decentralized applications and third-parties to adhere to strict\
  \ compliance requirements whilst still offering data privacy. This increases the ability to perform\
  \ business processes on-chain, leading to significant cost reduction.\n- Public. Users do not need the\
  \ approval of a trusted authority to use the Dusk Network blockchain. Besides, only minimal processing\
  \ power and modest IT resources to join. All users who possess the DUSK token can participate in the\
  \ consensus.\n\n###How does it work?\n\nThrough the use of a transactional model called Phoenix, Dusk\
  \ Network focuses on bringing privacy and anonymity to both transactions and smart-contracts. Additionally,\
  \ tokens deployed on Dusk Network can build on top of Zedger, a hybrid privacy-preserving model based\
  \ on Phoenix, specifically modeled for security tokens.\n\nThe ‘Segregated Byzantine Agreement’ (SBA)\
  \ consensus mechanism secures the network. According to the team from Dusk Network, SBA is an improvement\
  \ over the underlying Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism as it combines existing ideas like cryptographic\
  \ sortition (lottery), stealth time-locked transactions (private stake amounts) and a reputation module\
  \ to increase the chances of selecting honest nodes and further promote decentralization.\n\nDUSK tokens\
  \ can be used as a utility token to initiate transactions and atomic swaps, or for the deployment of\
  \ smart contracts. DUSK can also be staked to participate in consensus and serves as a means of exchanging\
  \ DUSK-denominated value. In the future, the team intends to expand the use-cases of DUSK by adding\
  \ it to an on-chain governance system.\n \nDusk Network was founded in 2018 and is based in Amsterdam,\
  \ the Netherlands."
