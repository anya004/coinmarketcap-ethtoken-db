description: "FToken (FT), the native asset of FT Public Chain (Fractal), means “The Future of Token”.\n\
  \nFToken originated from FCoin Token, which originally represented equity in FCoin, a crypto trading\
  \ platform. It completed the release of about 4.9 billion FT through transaction mining and “pre-release\
  \ unlocking” from 24 May 2018 to 14 Aug 2018. With the launch of the fractal project, FCoin Token was\
  \ upgraded to FToken on 15 October 2018 as it transitioned from “platform token” to a “public token”.\n\
  \nFT holders have a range of benefits including revenue distribution, voting, and community governance.\n\
  \nFT Public Chain aims to support the token economy by becoming the underlying economic infrastructure.\
  \ FT Public Chain has been launched online. \n\nFToken aims to lead the development of blockchain technology\
  \ and business models, with a view towards becoming a key token and representative in the field."
