description: 'FTX Leveraged tokens are ERC20 &amp; BEP2 tokens that have leveraged exposure to crypto.
  Using ETHBULL, a 3x long ETH token as an example, for every 1% ETH goes up in a day, ETHBULL goes up
  3%; for every 1% ETH goes down, ETHBULL goes down 3%.


  Users can buy leveraged tokens just like normal tokens on a spot market. However, there is no need for
  them to manage collateral, margin, liquidation prices, or anything that a normal margin user needs to
  manage.


  To learn more about how the FTX leveraged tokens work, please read a detailed guide and walkthrough
