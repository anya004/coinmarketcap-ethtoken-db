  Launched in March 2018 by a team based in Cambridge, UK, Fetch.ai aims to be at the forefront of accelerating\
  \ research and the deployment of emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI. \nIts solutions are\
  \ designed for people, organizations, and IoT. The project has created an Open Economic Framework (OEF)\
  \ that serves as a decentralized search and a value exchange platform for various autonomous economic\
  \ agents. This is supported by a smart ledger that can reportedly support more than 30,000 transactions\
  \ per second, and which is intended to meet the demands of the next generation of connected devices.\
  \ Fetch.ai has digital intelligence at its heart: it aims to deliver actionable predictions, instant\
  \ trust information, enable the construction of robust collaborative models, and improve efficiencies\
  \ and streamlining processes.\nIts solutions are designed for people, organizations, and IoT. The project\
