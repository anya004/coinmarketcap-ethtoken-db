  Metronome aims to optimize for self-governance, reliability, and portability. Founded by a number of
  veterans in the space (e.g. Jeff Garzik, Matthew Roszak), Metronome is founded on three key design principles:

  <li>Self-governance with no undue influence from founders after initial launch and public access â€” contract
  governance starts at launch.</li>

  <li>Reliability and predictability where issuance and supply are immutable</li>

  <li>Portability to enable maximum decentralization, even across different blockchains. The first ''chainhop''
  took place in summer 2019, between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic</li>'
