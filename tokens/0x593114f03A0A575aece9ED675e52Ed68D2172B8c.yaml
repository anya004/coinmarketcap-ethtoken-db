  \ \nBidiPass (BDP) describes itself as an identity authentication protocol built on Ethereum. \nThe\
  \ BidiPass Authenticator aims to offer decentralized 3FA for enhanced infrastructure security. The BidiPass\
  \ platform aims to offer a user-friendly, secure, and reliable method to authorize actions within connected\
  \ platforms (e.g. approving transactions on a trading platform) by using a two-layer security protocol\
  \ that operates in a distributed, peer-to-peer manner. The BidiPass blockchain architecture is based\
  \ on a hybrid approach which combines private and public blockchains in order to achieve security, performance,\
  \ and low operational costs.\nThe BidiPass Authenticator aims to offer decentralized 3FA for enhanced\
