  Internxt aims to offer a suite of innovative services that are suitable to be used by the mass-market.
  X Cloud, Internxt''s first service, is described by the team as a distributed, secure, and private cloud
  storage service which strives to compete with services such as Dropbox, Sync, and Amazon S3.

  Through decentralization and zero-knowledge encryption, the team aims to create an ecosystem for users
  to enjoy the benefits of cloud services with added security and privacy. With X Cloud, files are client-side
  encrypted, fragmented, and replicated in different machines across the globe. X Cloud can be accessed
  via its web, desktop or smartphone apps, as well as via API.

  Internxt''s token (INXT) is used as a means of payment to Hosts who participate in the X Core program.
  There are 629,000 INXT circulating. This supply is also INXT''s max supply since no more INXT will be
  generated. At X Core, Hosts can earn money by hosting small pieces of encrypted files. X Cloud customers
  pay Hosts, directly or indirectly, with INXT. Fiat can also be used to automatically purchase INXT at
  market price and sent to Hosts participating in the X Core program. Internxt will eventually reserve
  a small % (commission) from the transactions made, which will be used to improve its products and services.
