description: "Aeron aspires to become the new standard of aviation safety powered by blockchain to create\
  \ a decentralized system of storing, recording, and verification of all data concerning the aviation\
  \ industry to make our flights safer to fly.\n\nAeron’s solution relies on blockchain technology to\
  \ track aircraft maintenance and pilot logs. Aeron is constructing a database and an online system that\
  \ is decentralized, hosting global data on aircraft, flight schools, and pilots. This electronic logging\
  \ system would force pilots to have logs that reflect accurate flight hours, making aviation safer for\
  \ everyone involved. Its aim is to create “airline in a pocket” — a smart blockchain-based solution.\
  \ The pilot’s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects\
  \ and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools, and fixed base\
  \ operators. In case of any mismatch in data between any Aeron data source with either the Air Traffic\
  \ Control, pilot, or operator, aviation authorities can quickly detect and eliminate the problem. Aviation\
  \ authorities can also detect any pilots operating with an expired license. \n\nAeron (ARN) utility\
  \ token is incorporated in Aeron products. It helps to enhance product usage, allow contribution to\
  \ the ecosystem, product access, and ownership. ARN is a bootstrapping engagement. While the token will\
  \ enable access to valuable features within the Aeron platform, it will not be limited by the Aeron\
  \ mobile applications."
