  The Quant Network team developed Quant as a cryptocurrency token based on the Ethereum blockchain. The
  solutions offered by Quant include Overledger OS and GoVerify.

  According to the whitepaper, the initial goals of the Overledger project were to develop an interface
  to connect the world’s networks to multiple blockchains, bridge existing networks to new blockchains,
  and to develop a blockchain operating system with a protocol and platform that allows developers to
  create next-generation multi-chain applications.

  Their proposition for GoVerify is to allow people to verify and check whether any emails, SMS, mail,
  or phone calls received appear as legitimate and actually from the stated sender.
