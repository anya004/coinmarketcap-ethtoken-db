description: "Edge networking describes itself as a distributed computing paradigm which aims to bring\
  \ data storage and computation as close to the point of need as possible, pushing applications, data,\
  \ and computing power away from centralized data centers. It was designed to reduce the volumes of data\
  \ that must be moved, the consequent traffic, and the distance the data must travel, providing lower\
  \ latency and reduced transmission costs. \nEdge networking describes itself as a distributed computing\
