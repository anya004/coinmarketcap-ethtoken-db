description: 'MXC is a Utility Token, also commonly referred to as an Internet of Things (IoT) Token.
  MXC is building a global data network to allow wireless devices to connect and communicate more efficiently
  and over longer distances than currently used WiFi and Bluetooth methods. The MXProtocol and the interoperable
  Para-Chain network are designed to help cities, companies, and individuals profit/benefit from building
  an LPWAN network and using it to both transmit and manage data. Via MXC contour payments, MXC developers
  have devised an integrated IoT payment solution to allow automated machine to machine payments and IoT
  transactions to occur within a matter of seconds.
