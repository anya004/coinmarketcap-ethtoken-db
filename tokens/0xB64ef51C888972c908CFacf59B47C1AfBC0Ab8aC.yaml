description: 'Storj (STORJ) hopes to provide decentralised cloud storage to its community. Storj works
  on the premise that each user is entitled to the same amount of space on the network as they make available
  to the community. Users can also receive payment for renting their extra disk space. Files are split
  up into smaller components and dispersed across an array of devices, with users maintaining control
  of their keys, which grants them access to their files, at all times. As a result, this decentralised
  cloud storage model creates additional security for users relative to centralized cloud storage providers.
