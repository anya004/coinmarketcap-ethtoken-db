The custom features and incentive mechanisms developed by WAX are designed to optimize the blockchain\u2019s usability in e-commerce, and encourage voting on guilds and proposals.\nWAX claims to have created a suite of blockchain-based tools upon which dApps, marketplaces, and native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are built. These tools would include services to support e-commerce operations such as an interactive block explorer, wallet, SSO and OAUTH, item creation, an RNG service, interactive item viewers, marketplace creation, and more. The resulting technology represents a blockchain architecture that is reportedly fast (500 millisecond block times), fee-less for customers, less expensive for developers, and leverages voting rewards to incentivize participation in the selection of block producers and proposals.\nWAX claims to have created a suite of blockchain-based tools upon which dApps, marketplaces, and native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are built.
