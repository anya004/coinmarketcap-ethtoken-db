description: 'Natmin Pure Escrow describes itself as a decentralized application that provides blockchain-based
  escrow services. It aims to disrupt the Escrow industry by utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate
  escrow transactions for a fraction of the price of conventional escrow services. Natmin claims to be
  a self-regulating system that provides secure transactions between the buyer and seller with low fees.
  Natmin utilizes smart contract technology to implement and regulate Escrow transactions, which removes
  the need for a middleman, thus reducing transaction costs and the possibility of fraud. The Natmin Token
  (NAT) aims to provide security and peace of mind between the buyer and seller. It is built on the ERC223
  standard using the Ethereum Blockchain.
