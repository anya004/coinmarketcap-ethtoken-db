description: "Vid aims to become a next-generation video journaling application that gives control to\
  \ its users. Data is secured through zero-knowledge encryption, so only the user can access their content.\
  \ Blockchain technology powers the companyâ€™s internal VID Token, which is a digital currency used to\
  \ transfer value across the network. Content creators can earn VID Tokens when other users view their\
  \ videos. Brands and advertisers can also pay content creators directly with the VID Token, without\
  \ Vid taking a cut. \n\nThe company has developed proprietary technology that leverages AI and machine\
  \ learning techniques to automatically edit clips to the beat of the music, identify the most relevant\
  \ parts of a clip, speed up and slow down content, and apply filters that give the final product a polished\
  \ and professional feel. Vid holds two patents that protect its technology, with several others in review.\
  \ The company is headquartered in Los Angeles, with satellite offices in South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore,\
  \ and the Cayman Islands."
