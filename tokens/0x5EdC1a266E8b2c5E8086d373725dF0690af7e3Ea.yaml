description: 'YottaChain is a public chain created by Wang Donglin, one of the Top 10 Young Scientists
  in China, together with his team for blockchain storage. It builds a massive interstellar storage pool
  by connecting the distributed resources around the world. The pool overwhelms the existing centralized
  storage technology with ten thousand times higher reliability, a fraction of the original cost, DDoS
  resistance, and disaster tolerance and other features, so as to guarantee the data sovereignty of each
  user.
