  Data Transaction Token (XD) is the native digital asset of the Scroll Project, a series of distributed
  ledgers that define different use-cases catering to data privacy and authority. It aims to facilitate
  efficient data transactions and the implementation of the transactions’ permanent records on the public
  blockchain.

  The Scroll Project was established in 2017, originally starting as a peer to peer file-sharing application
  that sought to eliminate the risk of individual user data leaks and eventually grew into a software
  suite built around Distributed Ledger Technologies.

  The digital asset, Data Transaction Token, is used to initiate private data transactions by users onto
  the public Ethereum Blockchain, rendering each transaction immutable.
