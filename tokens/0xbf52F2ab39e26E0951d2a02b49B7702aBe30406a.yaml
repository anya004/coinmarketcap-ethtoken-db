description: 'ODEM (ODE), short for "On-Demand Education Marketplace", is a blockchain-based distributed
  network that allows university students to interact with their professors and academic partners without
  intermediaries. It seeks to bring users together so as to raise the quality of accessible education
  but at a reasonable cost. The ODEM platform lets qualified educators anywhere in the world create customized
  curriculum and educational programs that can equip students with practical knowledge. It then connects
  students with various educational hubs via a smart contract payment platform. The platform also allows
  students to submit custom curricula requests to ODEM educators for bidding, and can also provide students
  with more choices for housing, transportation, and other necessities. Upon the completion of each course,
  students will receive certificates that will also be posted to the blockchain.
