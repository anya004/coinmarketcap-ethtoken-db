description: "ebakus aims to improve the user experience for dApps and make them more accessible. From\
  \ a technology perspective, it has DPOS consensus that reportedly allows it to scale with low latency,\
  \ a new way of handling transaction fees, and an in-contract decentralized Database (ebakusDB). It is\
  \ backwards compatible with ethereumâ€™s go-ethereum API(geth) and the EVM. \n\nIn ebakus, user transaction\
  \ fees are free.  Fees are paid with CPU time spent through proof of work, The team has also built a\
  \ js library wallet that can be embedded in a dApp. These factors reportedly enhance the user experience\
  \ for dApps."
