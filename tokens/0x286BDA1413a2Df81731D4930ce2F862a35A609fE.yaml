description: 'Tael (WABI) describes itself as a digital token used in the Tael ecosystem of consumer products.
  Consumer goods inside the ecosystem are secured from counterfeit attempts through banking-level, tamper-proof
  NFC smart-labels, which are linked to their digital representations on the blockchain. Consumers touch
  the label with their smartphones to verify a product’s authenticity, discover the product’s journey
  along the supply chain, and are rewarded for their purchases with the Tael token. Tael is used as a
  payment method across the Tael ecosystem and its partners.
