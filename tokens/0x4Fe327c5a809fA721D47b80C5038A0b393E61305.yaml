description: 'Project IOTW (https://iotw.io/), under AnApp Blockchain Technologies Limited, aims to build
  a blockchain-enabled IoT data platform that unifies data across IoT devices/applications using Proof
  of Assignment (PoA) and micro-mining protocols. The blockchain micro-mining software can reportedly
  run on IoT devices to mine cryptocurrencies. According to the team, it can be embedded into different
  IoT chipsets and downloaded into existing IoT devices through a firmware update. The founding team reportedly
  has about 30 years of experience in the semiconductor and IoT hardware industries. AnApp, the developer
  behind IOTW was selected by 500 Startups (https://500.co) to participate in the 24th Batch Accelerator
  Program (Batch 24).
