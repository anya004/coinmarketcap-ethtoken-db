description: "Nectar was originally launched in 2017 by the Bitfinex spin-off exchange, Ethfinex — a team\
  \ based out of London, UK — with the purpose of rewarding market makers for the value they create whilst\
  \ simultaneously serving as the primary voting mechanism, allowing traders to govern the exchange and\
  \ decide, among other things, which tokens they wish to see listed next. The project was designed to\
  \ experiment with and develop novel governance processes with the aim of solving pain points seen with\
  \ centralized exchanges including opaque and costly token listing procedures. \nNectar was originally\
