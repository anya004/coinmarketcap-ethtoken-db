description: Launched in April of 2019 by Martin Floreani (FloSports) and the rest of the Rokfin founding
  team based in Austin, Texas, Receive Access Ecosystem (RAE) fixes a flaw content providers face with
  their current digital network options as the result of Ben Thompson's Aggregation Theory. The RAE Token
  aims to address this fundamental inefficiency, allowing content providers to tap into the network surplus
  that is created by consolidating their offerings, reaching a broader audience and increasing consumer
  LTV. The token aligns network participants in a way where they correctly benefit as the network grows.
