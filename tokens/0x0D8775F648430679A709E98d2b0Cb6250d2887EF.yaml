  Led by Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla), Basic Attention Token (BAT) project
  is an open-source, decentralized ad exchange platform built on the Ethereum platform. The project seeks
  to address fraud and opaqueness in digital advertising.

  The token aims to correctly price user attention within the platform. Advertisers pay BAT to website
  publishers for the attention of users. The BAT ecosystem includes Brave, an open-source, privacy-centered
  browser designed to block trackers and malware. It leverages blockchain technology to anonymously and
  track user attention securely and rewards publishers accordingly.
