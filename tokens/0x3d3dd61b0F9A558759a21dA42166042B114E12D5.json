Using ETHBULL, a 3x long ETH token as an example, for every 1% ETH goes up in a day, ETHBULL goes up 3%; for every 1% ETH goes down, ETHBULL goes down 3%.\n\nUsers can buy leveraged tokens just like normal tokens on a spot market. However, there is no need for them to manage collateral, margin, liquidation prices, or anything that a normal margin user needs to manage.\n\nTo learn more about how the FTX leveraged tokens work, please read a detailed guide and walkthrough here: (https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032509552-Leveraged-Token-Walkthrough)","id":5415,"links":{"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x3d3dd61b0F9A558759a21dA42166042B114E12D5","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x3d3dd61b0F9A558759a21dA42166042B114E12D5"],"website":["https://ftx.com/tokens/EOSBEAR"]},"markets":[{"base":{"currency_id":5415,"currency_symbol":"EOSBEAR","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EOSBEAR"},"exchange_id":524,"exchange_name":"FTX","pair":"EOSBEAR/USD","quote":{"currency_id":2781,"currency_symbol":"USD","currency_type":"fiat","exchange_symbol":"USD"},"url":"https://ftx.com/trade/EOSBEAR/USD"},{"base":{"currency_id":5415,"currency_symbol":"EOSBEAR","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EOSBEAR"},"exchange_id":544,"exchange_name":"MXC","pair":"EOSBEAR/USDT","quote":{"currency_id":825,"currency_symbol":"USDT","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"USDT"},"url":"https://www.mxc.com/trade/easy#EOSBEAR_USDT"},{"base":{"currency_id":5415,"currency_symbol":"EOSBEAR","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EOSBEAR"},"exchange_id":524,"exchange_name":"FTX","pair":"EOSBEAR/USDT","quote":{"currency_id":825,"currency_symbol":"USDT","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"USDT"},"url":"https://ftx.com/trade/EOSBEAR/USDT"},{"base":{"currency_id":5415,"currency_symbol":"EOSBEAR","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EOSBEAR"},"exchange_id":482,"exchange_name":"BKEX","pair":"EOSBEAR/USDT","quote":{"currency_id":825,"currency_symbol":"USDT","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"USDT"},"url":"https://www.bkex.com/trade/EOSBEAR_USDT"},{"base":{"currency_id":5415,"currency_symbol":"EOSBEAR","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EOSBEAR"},"exchange_id":302,"exchange_name":"Gate.io","pair":"EOSBEAR/USDT","quote":{"currency_id":825,"currency_symbol":"USDT","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"USDT"},"url":"https://gate.io/trade/eosbear_usdt"},{"base":{"currency_id":5415,"currency_symbol":"EOSBEAR","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EOSBEAR"},"exchange_id":453,"exchange_name":"BitMax","pair":"EOSBEAR/USDT","quote":{"currency_id":825,"currency_symbol":"USDT","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"USDT"},"url":"https://bitmax.io/#/trade/usdt/eosbear"},{"base":{"currency_id":5415,"currency_symbol":"EOSBEAR","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EOSBEAR"},"exchange_id":16,"exchange_name":"Poloniex","pair":"EOSBEAR/USDT","quote":{"currency_id":825,"currency_symbol":"USDT","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"USDT"},"url":"https://poloniex.com/exchange#usdt_eosbear"}],"name":"3x Short EOS Token","rank":2078,"slug":"3x-short-eos-token","status":"active","symbol":"EOSBEAR"}
