  BCS aims to build a blockchain-based retail commercial credit economy ecosystem.

  BCS uses self-optimized POBC (goodwill certification) as the underlying consensus mechanism and aims
  to introduce the real world credit system to provide better operation and support for anonymous blockchain
  networks. BCS focuses on the retail industry and aims to support supply chain traceability, quantifiable
  credit, transparent data, consumer shopping, membership services, precision marketing, and centralized
  procurement scenarios.
