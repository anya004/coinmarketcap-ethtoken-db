It consists of an ecosystem where gamers can, on top of buying and playing games, resell their used games and items, and earn money through their participation in Ultra. Game developers will benefit from new revenue streams, SDKs, overlay technologies and blockchain tools that power up their games via features like item distribution. The product is expected to launch to the public in 2020.\n\nUltra has developed its own customized EOSIO blockchain which aims to provide free user account creation and higher transaction throughput through better resource allocation. Partnerships for Ultra include the semiconductor company AMD and the gaming publisher Ubisoft.\n\nThe Ultra token (UOS) serves a variety of purposes within the Ultra platform, both at the protocol (staking) and at the app level (transactions).
