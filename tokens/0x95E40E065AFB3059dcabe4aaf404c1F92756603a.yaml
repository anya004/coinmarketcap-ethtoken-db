description: Launched on 12/12/2019 by a team based in Singapore. KDAG aims to solve the problem of efficiency.  KDAG
  architecture completely replaces the traditional chain structure. The "embracing algorithm" instead
  of consensus completely solves the data consistency, and the "wave effect" greatly improves the random
  attribute of the node's legal reference, and realizes the high security of transaction privacy.
