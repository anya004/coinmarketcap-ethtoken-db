description: 'Decentraland (MANA) defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum
  blockchain that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications. In this virtual
  world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon, and monetize. Decentraland
  uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC20 token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC721
  LAND tokens.
