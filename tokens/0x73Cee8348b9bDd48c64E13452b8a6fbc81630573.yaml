description: Launched on 18/11/2019 by a team based in Nigeria, Egoras aims to build a  blockchain-based
  re-commerce/resale marketplace that allows sellers and buyers of used items to exchange value quickly
  without any intermediaries. Egoras combines concepts from re-commerce with lessons learned from building
  cryptocurrencies. The team believes that a fair accounting system that consistently reflects each personâ€™s
  contribution is key to driving participation in any marketplace, currency or free-market economy.
