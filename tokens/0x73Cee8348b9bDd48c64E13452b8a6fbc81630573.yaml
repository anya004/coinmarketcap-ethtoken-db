description: 'Launched on 18/11/2019 by a team-based in the United States, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Nigeria,
  Egoras protocol comprises two tokens: Daric token (DXAU - a decentralized stable coin pegged to 1 XAU.)
  and Egoras token (EGR- a cryptocurrency used to facilitate the stability of the Daric token ). EGR tokens
  are also used to pay transaction fees on the Egoras platform and provides holders with voting rights
  within Egoras''s voting system.


  Egoras uses the Ethereum network for the transaction layer (sending and receiving EGR tokens, as well
  as interacting with the EGORAS smart contract), whilst the consensus code and staking mechanism is contained
  in the EGORAS smart contract.


  Egoras allows users to stake his or her EGR coins for a share of the new coin issuance, or inflation
  and contains features designed to incentivize behaviours that encourage price appreciation, stabilise
  DXAU and disincentivize behaviours that encourage harm to the price. The Egoras smart contract penalizes
  stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of EGR for longer periods.
  The maximum possible annual inflation of EGR is designed to be 3.69% after the first year of launch.'
