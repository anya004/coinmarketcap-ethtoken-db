description: Launched on 31 December 2018 in Brazil, NFXCoin is the native token of NFXTRADER, a new exchange
  that aims to introduce new features with the integration of NETELLER and launch a card for users to
  facilitate the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Any platform user holding a minimum of 2,000 NFXCoins in
  his/her wallet will pay only 50% of the trading fees provided by the platform. The project will also
  reportedly have a digital bank (NFXBank) where customers will have access to services and still have
  facilities for the crypto market. Users will also be able to receive cashback and recurring credits
  on NFXCoins just for using the services of NFXBank.
