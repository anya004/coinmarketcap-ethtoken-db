description: 'The Q DAO Platform allows users to generate various stablecoins. The stablecoins (USDQ,
  KRWQ, and others) can reportedly be generated by any person who has Bitcoins at his/her disposal. The
  team envisages the biggest use cases to be cross-border value transfers, payments for goods and services,
  as well as long-term savings. Additionally, the stablecoin generation system is intended to set the
  foundation for a margin trading platform.
