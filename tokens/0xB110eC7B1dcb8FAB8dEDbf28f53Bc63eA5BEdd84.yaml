description: "The Sphere Identity Project uses blockchain technology for the creation of a global identity\
  \ platform with applications for both businesses and consumers. In addition to being committed to the\
  \ advancement of blockchain and distributed technologies, the underlying values of the project are security\
  \ and privacy by design. As a global platform, the project is reportedly compliant with GDPR, CBPR,\
  \ and various other privacy/data protection regulations. \n The applications being built address three\
  \ problems. Firstly, for individuals, it aims to provide the ability to store and share identity documents\
  \ and data with a level of security and privacy. The second problem that its applications reportedly\
  \ solves is the customer on-boarding problem that most businesses experience with their websites. With\
  \ Sphere Identity, it aims to take away the friction involved in signing up and offering an alternative\
  \ to online forms.  Thirdly, with changing legislation for data protection, privacy and KYC businesses\
  \ data requirements are changing. The project provides inbuilt flexibility in data choices that enable\
  \ businesses to respond to changing requirements. \n The XID Token powers Sphere Identity's rewards\
  \ system. The smart contract-based reward system rewards individuals whenever they share their personal\
  \ data with registered businesses. The rewards are exchangeable and can be used to pay for upgrades."
