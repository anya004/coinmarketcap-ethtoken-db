  \ enables the interoperability of child chain and main chain. It can reportedly support 256+ child chains\
  \ in testnet 1.0 with 1064 nodes globally. The project claims that the network supports 126K TPS and\
  \ can be scaled linearly as the number of child chains increases.</li>\n<li>Patented PDBFT algorithm\
  \ that combines VRF+BLS+BFT is reportedly able to support more nodes than traditional PBFT algorithms.</li>\n\
  <li>Oracle mechanism based on the knowledge graph reportedly makes it easier to encapsulate smart contracts\
  \ - W3C compliant smart data addresses the issue of non-intelligence in smart contracts</li>\n<li>Safe\
  \ Delegation and Blind Bidding that reportedly enables a fair and secure validator election during epoch\
  \ switches.</li>\n<li>Cross-chain capability. The smart contracts of PCHAIN can purportedly be invoked\
  \ with other non-native tokens (BCH, ERC20) by using the provided toolkit.</li>"
