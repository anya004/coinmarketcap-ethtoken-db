description: 'ETHplode describes itself as a store of value built on the Ethereum blockchain with deflationary
  characteristics. Whenever $ETHPLO is transferred, 0.5% of the amount is burned. According to the team,
  this self-destructive functionality increases the asset''s scarcity over time and is hardcoded directly
  into its monetary structure. ETHplode is based on the design of the Bomb token – a hyper-deflationary,
  self-destructing currency.
