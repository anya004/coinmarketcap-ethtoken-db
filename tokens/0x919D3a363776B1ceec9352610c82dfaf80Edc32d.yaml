  The gold is reportedly obtained directly from Gold Mining Companies. GoldFund intends to loan capital
  to near term gold producers and that is repaid in Gold. The Gold is reportedly sold on its gold commodities
  exchange, and GFUN token holders would then be able to use their GFUN token to obtain a discount on
  the purchase of physical gold.
