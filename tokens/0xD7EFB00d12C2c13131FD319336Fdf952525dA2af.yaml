description: 'Launched in San Francisco, Proton (XPR) is a new public blockchain and smart contract platform
  designed for both consumer applications and peer-peer payments. Proton aims to provide a secure, verified
  identity account which is integrated with a financial settlements layer that allows users to directly
  link this identity with fiat accounts, pull funds and buy crypto, and use that crypto seamlessly in
  apps, all without sending any of the user’s private, sensitive information. Proton removes the concept
  of sharing private keys directly with merchants by creating a permission-less layer that exists on top
  of traditional card networks and banks.


  The user maintains the private key in confidence while permitting institutions who wish to authenticate
  the user to check with trusted institutions via public keys. The verification from the trusted institution
  will confirm the user’s identity without revealing the user’s associated private key.'
