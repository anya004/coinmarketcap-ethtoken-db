description: "AppCoins is an open and distributed protocol for app stores based on the Ethereum blockchain\
  \ and smart contracts. It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows\
  \ through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the\
  \ app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically\
  \ provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders\
  \ will have to contribute to its development and adoption. Furthermore, API integration will streamline\
  \ implementation.\n\nAppCoins integrates app stores, users, developers, advertisers, and OEMs. This\
  \ system is app store agnostic, existing across different mobile platforms (Android &amp; iOS). The\
  \ different app stores act as oracles of the smart contracts, which are associated with each of the\
  \ platformâ€™s core transactions. This system creates a trust layer for the economy, obviating the need\
  \ for intermediaries. AppCoins aims to become the universal language of the app economy.\n\nThe protocol\
  \ also includes a so-called Proof-of-Attention system. Users, app stores, and OEMs receive tokens through\
  \ the Proof-of Attention concept as a reward. Developers that want to advertise their apps can be sure\
  \ that the user has installed and used it. The users reinvest their tokens via inapp purchases and this\
  \ would theoretically create a virtuous loop that boosts the AppCoins economic growth.\n\n- Link to\
