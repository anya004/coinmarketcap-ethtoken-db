  Telcoin (TEL) aims to connect with mobile networks globally, enabling easy conversion between telecom
  mobile money, prepaid credit, and postpaid billing platforms.

  The team intends to distribute the TEL ERC-20 token to telecom operators, who will then sell it to their
  subscribers. The team also intends to leverage its positioning to bring roaming spending (offer tourists
  access to local currency spending), international aid (facilitating disbursements to underbanked), and
  online payments in general.
