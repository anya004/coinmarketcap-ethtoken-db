description: 'The Echoin public chain aims to create a decentralized energy trading network using blockchain
  technology. The Echoin Ecosystem will use a dual token system. EC is the gas in the Echoin public chain
  ecosystem, used to pay the network maintainers and verification nodes. The EUSD is a stable currency
  generated by the pledge of fiat currencies (i.e. US Dollars). EUSD will be issued on the Echoin public
  chain, and its security and credibility will be backed by bank(s) and/or other independent agencies.
