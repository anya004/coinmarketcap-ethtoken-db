description: "Founded in early 2017, Upfiring was established to create an alternative to traditional\
  \ P2P file-sharing protocols by incentivizing seeders through the use of a tokenized file-sharing economy.\
  \ Traditional P2P file-sharing and networks offer no incentives for seeders and as a result, low file\
  \ availability and slow downloading speeds are frequent issues. By incentivizing seeding, Upfiring aims\
  \ to create a healthier file-sharing network that allows content creators and seeders to be rewarded\
  \ directly for sharing content without any third-party intermediaries. \nFounded in early 2017, Upfiring\

  \ MacOS, and Linux. The application allows users to generate encrypted .ufr files with embedded price\
  \ data and seed them on the Upfiring network. Users earn UFR tokens in exchange for seeding and keeping\
  \ files online. Seeder smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum network mediate the movement of files\
  \ across the network, maintain seeder UFR balances and allow for the decryption of files when warranted.\n\
