description: The Bodhi project, which was a decentralized prediction market, has migrated from the QTUM
  and Ethereum blockchain to its own blockchain - Naka Chain. Naka Bodhi Token (NBOT) is the governance
  token for the Naka Chain. The original two tokens (BOT and BOE) have been merged into one with a fixed
  ratio of 1 BOT = 0.59 NBOT and 1 BOE = 0.41 NBOT.
