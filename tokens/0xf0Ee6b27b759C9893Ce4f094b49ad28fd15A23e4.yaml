  Enigma (ENG) is a crypto platform that’s trying to solve the problem of privacy on the blockchain by
  giving access to data storage and privacy while remaining scalable. Enigma aims to extend Ethereum Smart
  Contracts by introducing secret contracts.

  Secret contracts would operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the contract doesn’t occur on the
  Ethereum blockchain, but rather sorts any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes
  them redundantly among Enigma nodes.
