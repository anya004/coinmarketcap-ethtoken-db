The Loopring protocol smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof circuits allow the building of high-performance DEXes using a zkRollup construction. This allows for higher throughput and lower settlement costs without sacrificing Ethereum-level security guarantees. LRC token can be staked by holders to earn protocol fees, and by DEXes as a bond to follow protocol-defined behaviour.","id":1934,"links":{"chat":["https://t.me/loopring_en","https://discord.gg/KkYccYp"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/loopring-protocol"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/loopringorg"],"source_code":["https://github.com/loopring"],"technical_doc":["https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/blob/master/packages/loopring_v3/DESIGN.md"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/loopringorg"],"website":["https://loopring.org"]},"name":"Loopring","slug":"loopring","status":"delisted","symbol":"LRC"}
