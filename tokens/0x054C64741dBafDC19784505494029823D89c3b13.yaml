description: Developed by Atom Solutions, Eternal Token (XET) is an ERC-20 token that uses Proof of Work
  for validating transactions. Its precursor was Eternal Coin (XEC), a non-blockchain based virtual currency,
  which was only available to authorized users in specific countries (e.g. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong
  and Philippines). For non-residents of the aforementioned countries, Eternal Token (XET) can be used
  to acquire Eternal Coin (XEC) at a 1:10 ratio. Similar to XEC, XET is centralized in its operations
  in that transactions can be reversed.
