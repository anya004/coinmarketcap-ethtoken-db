description: 'Swarm provides a blockchain agnostic open infrastructure for digital securities, powered
  by the SWM ERC-20 utility token. Token issuers stake SWM when issuing a security token on any integrated
  blockchain (Ethereum, Stellar, or TRON), and SWM is staked to own and operate Swarm Masternodes, which
  maintain Market Access Protocol (MAP) and facilitate the compliant transfer of digital securities. Token
  holders may use SWM for community governance of the network, and SWM can also be used, alongside many
  other cryptocurrencies, for fundraising and settlement with service providers across the MAP network.
  Swarm''s vision is to improve access to financial investment opportunities by promoting and supporting
  the tokenization of assets, and by providing infrastructure for free.
