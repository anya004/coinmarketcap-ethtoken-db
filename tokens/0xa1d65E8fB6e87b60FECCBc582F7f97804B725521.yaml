description: DXdao describes itself as a decentralized community that develops, governs, and grows DeFi
  protocols and products. Its initial members were seeded through a 1-month process where over $20M in
  ETH and other tokens were staked and 400+ addresses received Reputation. They have been working on DeFi
  infrastructure like Mesa.eth, a recently launched frontend to the Gnosis Protocol, and Omen.eth, a prediction
  market platform. The DXdao is also involved in developing Mix.eth, governing DMM, and maintaining the
  DutchX trading protocol.
