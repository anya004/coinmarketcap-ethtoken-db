description: 'Power Ledger (POWR), based in Australia, encourages us to imagine a world in which electricity
  is dependable, affordable and clean for everyone. Powered by contracts on the Ethereum network, the
  peer-to-peer energy exchange platform, their most mature platform, aims to democratize the trading of
  energy with transparent systems that allow individuals and communities to select the source of their
  power. In their dual token model, POWR is the utility token that users would escrow in order to use
  the platform, whilst Sparkz represent electricity credits tied to local fiat for marketplace participants.
  Both are used to create part of an economy in which households that generate electricity can trade with
  their neighbors for a fair return.
