description: 'Polymath (POLY) is creating a global platform for issuing and investing in securities tokens.
  Polymath’s standard for blockchain security tokens aims to integrate the necessary regulatory requirements
  into smart contracts and comply with regulations. The project simplifies the legal process of creating
  and selling security tokens. It establishes a new token standard (ST20) and enforces compliance by whitelisting
  authorized investors and their Ethereum wallet addresses. The POLY token is used for payments on the
  platform, which facilitates exchanges between issuers, investors, service providers, and developers.
