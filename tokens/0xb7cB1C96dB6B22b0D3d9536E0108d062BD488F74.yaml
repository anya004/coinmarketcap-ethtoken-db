description: 'Waltonchain (WTC) is building an ecosystem that melds blockchain, RFID technology, and IoT
  (Internet of Things). The Walton team develops and produces Transaction ID-reading RFID chips, which
  can generate their own random ID hashes that are uploaded simultaneously to the blockchain via their
  RFID reader. This translates to enhanced operational efficiency, especially for supply chain use cases
  such high-end clothing identification, food &amp; drug traceability, and logistics tracking.
