  Pillar describes itself as the personal data and asset management platform that allows users to control
  what, when, and with whom their funds and information are shared. The project''s mission is to empower
  individuals through ownership of their personal data using decentralized technologies.

  The Pillar Wallet is intended to be an intuitive and social cryptocurrency management tool. It aims
  to allow users to build a contact book -- rather than searching for blockchain addresses -- so that
  sending assets is as easy as sending a message. It stores users'' entire transaction history, provides
  real-time notifications on all activity, offers 24/7 in-app support, and an end-to-end encrypted chat
  function. The next step is smart contract based, recoverable accounts, integrated with exchanges and
  token swap platforms. It aims to provide free, instant and private transactions via off-chain payment
  channels.

  As a native token, PLR powers the platform and is used for payments, services, providing access to the
  Pillar Payment network, and serves as a usage fee benchmark. Pillar users will be able to operate the
  wallet platform, manage assets and identity, transact with other users, access enhanced functionality,
  open payment channels, exchange supported synthetic assets, and cover network fees using only the PLR
  token.
