description: Swarm aims to build blockchain agnostic open infrastructure for digital securities, powered
  by the SWM utility token. Token issuers stake SWM when issuing a security token on any integrated blockchain
  (Ethereum, Stellar, or TRON), and SWM is staked to own and operate Swarm Masternodes, which maintain
  Market Access Protocol (MAP) and facilitate the compliant transfer of digital securities. Token holders
  may use SWM for community governance of the network, and SWM can also be used, alongside many other
  cryptocurrencies, for fundraising and settlement with service providers across the MAP network. Swarm's
  vision is to improve access to financial investment opportunities by promoting and supporting the tokenization
  of assets, and by providing infrastructure for free.
