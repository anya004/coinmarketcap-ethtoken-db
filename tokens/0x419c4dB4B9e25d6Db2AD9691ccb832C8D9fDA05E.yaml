description: 'DragonChain (DRGN) is a blockchain-based company and ecosystem originally developed by Disney
  in 2014. The project started as the “Disney Private Blockchain Platform” and was later released as open-source
  software in 2016. DragonChain is providing the serverless ecosystem that allows companies to start using
  blockchain applications in an easy, private, and secure way. They aim to give businesses a “turn-key”
  product that is compatible with the development stack that companies are currently used to like Java,
  C++, and Python. This means that businesses will now be able to build their own smart contracts (on
  the DragonChain platform) using common programming languages.
