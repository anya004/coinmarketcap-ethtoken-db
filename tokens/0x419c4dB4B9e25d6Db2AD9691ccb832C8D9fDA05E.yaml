description: "Dragonchain is it’s own hybrid blockchain platform for small businesses, enterprises, and\
  \ developers. Originally developed inside The Walt Disney Company in Seattle in 2014 by Joe Roets, and\
  \ then open-sourced in 2016. The public/private hybrid blockchain platform also allows integration with\
  \ external blockchains and legacy systems through Interchain™, integrating third party oracles, API's,\
  \ IoT, supply chain, and other business data. Dragonchain proved its interoperability in 2016 and is\
  \ currently using its Interchain™ to connect to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Ethereum Classic.\
  \ Easily migrate from off-chain, to on-chain, while remaining GDPR capable. Developers can write their\
  \ own smart contracts in any coding language, such as C++, Go, JavaScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Shell,\
  \ C#, Hy, Rails, PHP and others allowing them to build (decentralized) blockchain applications on-premise\
  \ or in multi-cloud environments. \n\n\nOn January 7, 2020, Dragonchain demonstrated over 250 million\
  \ transactions over a 24-hour livestream event, averaging over 1500 transactions per second. Later that\
  \ year Medek Health launched Covid SafePass with the City of Apopka, using Dragonchain blockchain solutions\
  \ in line with the FDA guidance on Digital Health Policies and Public Health Solutions for COVID-19.\
  \ Dragonchain also built several solutions in-house on top of the open source platform, including Dragon\
  \ Factor (decentralized identity), Den (decentralized social media), Provably Fair Contest System (contests,\
  \ casinos, lotteries, give-aways), Lyceum (Training courses &amp; certificates on chain), and Eternal\
  \ (archiving, legal proof, predictions). \n\n\nHow to ‘mine’?\n\n\nThere is no mining involved. The\
  \ community acts as a decentralized validation, diversity, and notary service. One of the patents granted\
  \ to Dragonchain revolves around loyalty &amp; rewards on blockchain. While the enterprise develops\
  \ their applications on a private Level 1 Business node, the Dragonchain community and selected partners\
  \ run their own Level 2 Validation, Level 3 Diversity, and Level 4 Notary nodes. Level 5 nodes are the\
  \ public checkpoints to external blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Chain. Level 5 nodes\
  \ can be run and managed by Dragonchain, or the specific blockchain itself through a partner program,\
  \ bringing interoperability to all blockchains. \n\n\nFor the Dragonchain community members who are\
  \ running nodes, the amount of TIME each node runner applies to a certain level, determines their rewards.TIME\
  \ is a loyalty score on top of the DRGN token. For each DRGN held in a non-exchange wallet, they receive\
  \ 1 TIME loyalty score per day automatically. The more TIME someone applies to a L2, L3, or L4 node,\
  \ the higher the reward granted when your node is selected through the matchmaking process. Community\
  \ members securing Dragon Net’s 5 levels of trust can join pooled nodes, or run their own unmanaged\
  \ nodes."
