description: 'LTO Network bills itself as a hybrid blockchain designed for trustless B2B collaboration.
  The private layer is for data sharing and process automation (each process residing on its own miniature
  ad-hoc permissionless private chain). The public layer acts as a global security settlement layer —
  an immutable digital notary. This hybrid approach reportedly makes LTO Network GDPR and data privacy
  compliant, as well as scalable and ready for adoption.
