description: "Vite describes itself as a public chain designed to provide a fast and feeless payment network\
  \ and low-cost dApp platform for use in enterprise-grade applications. Vite uses a Directed Acyclic\
  \ Graph (DAG) architecture with delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. To reduce the security\
  \ risks associated with DAG, Vite incorporates its Snapshot Chain technology.  \n\nThe core of Vite's\
  \ platform features asynchronous architecture, which reportedly allows for the (i)  separate writing\
  \ of requests and responses, (ii) transaction writing and confirmation, and (iii) communication between\
  \ contracts. For dApp development, Vite utilizes the Solidity++ smart contract language.\n\nVite aims\
  \ to provide a complete ecosystem of products to accommodate everyday users, traders, and developers.\
  \ Currently, its product suite includes a wallet, DEX (currently in beta), and a payment network. Vite\
  \ is working on a comprehensive set of SDKs that will allow developers to easily build dApps on its\
  \ platform."
