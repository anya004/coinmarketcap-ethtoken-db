description: '**What Is Vite?


  Vite has built a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based smart-contract platform, with a Snapshot Chain structure
  to facilitate zero-fee transactions and optimize transaction speed, reliability, and security. The Snapshot
  Chain of Vite utilizes Hierarchical Delegated Proof of Stake (“HDPoS”) to achieve network consensus,
  while supernodes take only staking rewards and no transaction fees. Vite virtual machine maintains compatibility
  with EVM, and utilizes asynchronous smart contract language, Solidity++.


  The VITE token is the currency for simple token transactions and smart-contract executions on the Vite
  network, with users staking VITE for transaction quota instead of consuming gas. VITE can also be used
  to vote for Snapshot Block Producers (aka supernodes). In addition, a VITE staker with unused transaction
  quota can lease such quota to dApps in exchange for their tokens. For instance, users can stake VITE
  in exchange of ViteX’s native decentralized exchange token, VX.


  Vite’s current products include a decentralized exchange (ViteX), a multi-purpose wallet application
  (Vite App), payments (VitePay), and government/enterprise blockchain applications (VitePlus):


  - ViteX is a decentralized exchange with on-chain orderbook and matching engine, and supports currently
  20+ digital assets.

  - Vite App is a mobile application that allows trading (ViteX), asset management (wallet), dapps (e.g
  Vite-based games) in one place.

  - VitePay is a fast and feeless payment solution, currently available to use in Singapore’s Ce La Vi
  Sky Bar and taxi services under the Midwest Global network - Users can pay for merchants with Vite wallet,
  who in turn receive payment with zero fees with near-instant settlement. VitePay is also integrated
  with the e-commerce platform OpenCart, and one can utilize VitePay at the official Vite store.

  - VitePlus is a Vite-based enterprise blockchain solution for governments and enterprises. Vite has
  developed a pilot app, SyraCoin, for the Syracuse government, allowing city housing fund donors to receive
  blockchain-based coupons that are redeemable for goods and services within city bounds.


  **How can you buy or mine VITE?


  You may purchase VITE at major exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, and Bittrex. To ''mine'' VITE, you may
  run a Snapshot Block Producer (aka supernode to partake in the HDPOS consensus process) on the Vite
  network, and receive block rewards in the form of the annual inflation of 30 million VITE coins. You
  may also run a full node and receive VITE rewards from the Vite foundation.
