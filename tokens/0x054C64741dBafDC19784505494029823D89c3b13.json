Its precursor was Eternal Coin (XEC), a non-blockchain based virtual currency, which was only available to authorized users in specific countries (e.g. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Philippines). For non-residents of the aforementioned countries, Eternal Token (XET) can be used to acquire Eternal Coin (XEC) at a 1:10 ratio. Similar to XEC, XET is centralized in its operations in that transactions can be reversed.","id":3134,"links":{"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4458425.0"],"chat":["https://t.me/xetofficial"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x054c64741dbafdc19784505494029823d89c3b13","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x054c64741dbafdc19784505494029823d89c3b13"],"source_code":["https://github.com/atom-solutions/EternalToken"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/AdminXET"],"website":["https://www.atom-solutions.jp/en/xetchange.php"]},"name":"ETERNAL TOKEN","rank":574,"slug":"eternal-token","status":"active","symbol":"XET","tags":["marketplace","payments"]}
