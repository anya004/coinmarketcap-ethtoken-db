description: VARC project is ultimately aiming to build a P2P market place platform where every single
  user can either be a producer or a buyer. The project has initiated business making by researching the
  existing problem in the current market that has no clear solution to it. Market bears countless kinds
  of people and products such as retailers, wholesalers, brand new products, and/or secondhand products.
  P2P market has major two categories when it comes to a business. VARC will eventually build a huge market
  place in the future, however, it will kick-off in the early stage of business by targeting the secondhand
  market.
