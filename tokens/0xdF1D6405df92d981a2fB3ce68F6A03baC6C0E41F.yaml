description: Verasity.io describes itself as a video player that provides 'rewarded video player technology'
  to major video publishers across the globe. Verasity.io purportedly offers a patent-pending Video Player
  that enables VRA rewards, monetization, and loyalty schemes within the video player wallet. The project
  claims that its technology is available to 280,000 video publishers with 240 million users and 50 billion
  monthly views. The goal is to bring engagement, audiences, and revenues back to video publisher sites
  from YouTube. Its attention-based model seeks to create a VRA token economy between viewers, video publishers,
  and advertisers.
