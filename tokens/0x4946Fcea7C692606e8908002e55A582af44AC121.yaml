description: 'FOAM''s mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized
  web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving
  and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is the FOAM Map, where a community
  of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven
  efforts, FOAM’s proof of location protocol aims to enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network
  of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure
  location verification services.
