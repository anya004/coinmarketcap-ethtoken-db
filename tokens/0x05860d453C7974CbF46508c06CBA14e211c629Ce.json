These tokenizable assets include both tangible and intangible ones. As these tokens are now tradeable, token owners will have a new means of extracting value from their assets. \n\nEdenChain aims to build a blockchain ecosystem that offers users a complete and seamless blockchain experience. In addition to EdenChain (platform service), the team also offers users Dorothy (dApp depository store), MoA (tokenization and asset management tools), and Pegasus (multicurrency payment solution).","id":3305,"links":{"chat":["https://t.me/edenchainio"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x05860d453c7974cbf46508c06cba14e211c629ce","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x05860d453c7974cbf46508c06cba14e211c629ce"],"message_board":["https://edenchain.io/get-started/blog/"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/edenchainio"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/edenchainio"],"website":["https://edenchain.io/"]},"markets":[{"base":{"currency_id":3305,"currency_symbol":"EDN","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EDN"},"exchange_id":415,"exchange_name":"Bilaxy","pair":"EDN/ETH","quote":{"currency_id":1027,"currency_symbol":"ETH","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"ETH"},"url":"https://bilaxy.com/trade/EDN_ETH"},{"base":{"currency_id":3305,"currency_symbol":"EDN","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EDN"},"exchange_id":311,"exchange_name":"KuCoin","pair":"EDN/BTC","quote":{"currency_id":1,"currency_symbol":"BTC","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"BTC"},"url":"https://trade.kucoin.com/EDN-BTC"},{"base":{"currency_id":3305,"currency_symbol":"EDN","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EDN"},"exchange_id":489,"exchange_name":"Bithumb Global","pair":"EDN/ETH","quote":{"currency_id":1027,"currency_symbol":"ETH","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"ETH"},"url":"https://www.bithumb.pro/en-us/spot/trade;symbol=EDN_ETH"},{"base":{"currency_id":3305,"currency_symbol":"EDN","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EDN"},"exchange_id":400,"exchange_name":"Hotbit","pair":"EDN/ETH","quote":{"currency_id":1027,"currency_symbol":"ETH","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"ETH"},"url":"https://www.hotbit.io/exchange?symbol=EDN_ETH"},{"base":{"currency_id":3305,"currency_symbol":"EDN","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EDN"},"exchange_id":400,"exchange_name":"Hotbit","pair":"EDN/BTC","quote":{"currency_id":1,"currency_symbol":"BTC","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"BTC"},"url":"https://www.hotbit.io/exchange?symbol=EDN_BTC"},{"base":{"currency_id":3305,"currency_symbol":"EDN","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EDN"},"exchange_id":311,"exchange_name":"KuCoin","pair":"EDN/ETH","quote":{"currency_id":1027,"currency_symbol":"ETH","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"ETH"},"url":"https://trade.kucoin.com/EDN-ETH"},{"base":{"currency_id":3305,"currency_symbol":"EDN","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EDN"},"exchange_id":489,"exchange_name":"Bithumb Global","pair":"EDN/BTC","quote":{"currency_id":1,"currency_symbol":"BTC","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"BTC"},"url":"https://www.bithumb.pro/en-us/spot/trade;symbol=EDN_BTC"},{"base":{"currency_id":3305,"currency_symbol":"EDN","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"EDN"},"exchange_id":310,"exchange_name":"IDEX","pair":"EDN/ETH","quote":{"currency_id":1027,"currency_symbol":"ETH","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"ETH"},"url":"https://idex.market/eth/edn"}],"name":"Eden","rank":1055,"slug":"eden","status":"active","symbol":"EDN"}
