It is pegged to a basket of selected stablecoins (35% USDC, 35% PAX and 30% TUSD), with constituents and weightings adjustable through on-chain governance. The bidirectional exchange (from constituents to USDx, and from USDx to a basket of constituents) are wholly on-chain and verifiable on Etherscan. \n\nUSDx has been integrated with Lendf.Me (a Money Market protocol of dForce) for interest-yielding and crypto loan applications. A yield-enhancing protocol will be launched to allow USDx holders to earn passive yields.","id":4621,"links":{"chat":["https://t.me/dforcenet","https://t.co/qsGjYNcvd2?amp=1"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xeb269732ab75a6fd61ea60b06fe994cd32a83549","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xeb269732ab75a6fd61ea60b06fe994cd32a83549"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/dforcenet"],"source_code":["https://github.com/dforcenetwork"],"technical_doc":["https://github.com/dforcenetwork/docs/blob/master/audit_report/PeckShield_audit_report_en.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/dForcenet"],"website":["https://dforce.network/","https://usdx.dforce.network/"]},"markets":[{"base":{"currency_id":4621,"currency_symbol":"USDX","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"USDX"},"exchange_id":400,"exchange_name":"Hotbit","pair":"USDX/USDT","quote":{"currency_id":825,"currency_symbol":"USDT","currency_type":"cryptocurrency","exchange_symbol":"USDT"},"url":"https://www.hotbit.io/exchange?symbol=USDX_USDT"}],"name":"USDx stablecoin","rank":710,"slug":"usdx-stablecoin","status":"active","symbol":"USDX"}
