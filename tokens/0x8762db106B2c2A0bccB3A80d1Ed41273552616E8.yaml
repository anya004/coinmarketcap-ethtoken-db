description: 'The Reserve protocol comprises two tokens: the Reserve token (RSV - a decentralized stablecoin)
  and the Reserve Rights token (RSR - a cryptocurrency used to facilitate the stability of the Reserve
  token and confers the cryptographic right to purchase excess Reserve tokens as the network grows). The
  Reserve movement describes itself as a collection of people who believe that cryptocurrencies can do
  better than fiat money, and that none of the existing options will be able to scale to global use, maintain
  stable purchasing power, and not be shut down. The team''s goal is to make the most accessible, economically
  strongest, and most robust-to-attack currency and over time, convince a large portion of the world to
  replace other currencies with it.
